# A plethora of CV's...

To begin with, please enjoy the standard Developer Format (written in [Markdown](https://github.com/Mervodactyl/cvDrafts/blob/master/cv.md) naturally)

Prefer a [PDF]() version? // yet to be added //

What about a CV displayed as a [JSON object](https://github.com/Mervodactyl/cvDrafts/blob/master/resumeObject.json)?

How about my own creation of a single page [website](https://github.com/Mervodactyl/mePage) instead?
