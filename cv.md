# Mervé Silk

__aka:__ A code making, D&D playing, cake eating, sea slug loving, Front End Developer with a penchant for creating apps and websites to look and feel the way you want them to.


## Web Development

I have a wide skill set including OOD, TDD, JavaScript, Sass, JSON, jQuery, agile practices, HTML, CSS, and more besides.
As proven by my Github, I am a fast learning and determined individual. Alongside my own private study, I enrolled at Makers Academy on their intensive programming and web development course. I am currently looking for a Front End Developer role in a place where I will be able to apply my coding skills and encouraged to push my abilities further.
