# Mervé Silk

__aka:__ A code making, D&D playing, cake eating, sea slug loving, Front End Developer with a penchant for creating apps and websites to look and feel the way you want them to.


## Web Development

I am a frequent attendant at coding meet ups/ conferences, including EPIC FEL 2015, Node LDN, and Code Bar. As proven by my Github, I am a fast learning and determined individual. My past experiences in planning engineering & project management mean I work well to deadlines and together in complex technical teams. Alongside my own private study, I took the initiative and enrolled at Makers Academy on their intensive programming and web development course. I have much relevant experience from this past year as a result of my tireless efforts. It has been exhilarating, exhausting, frustrating and fun.  I’m currently looking for a Front End Developer role in a place where I will be able to apply my coding skills and encouraged to push my abilities further.

## Interests
In my spare time you will find me writing readable, maintainable, tested code. You will also find me shamelessly feeding my book addiction, sketching on my art pad, mastering Wing Chun Kung Fu, or swinging from an Aerial hoop in Circus school. If given the tiniest opportunity, I will tell you why Digimon is superior to Pokémon.
